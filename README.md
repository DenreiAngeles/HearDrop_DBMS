## How It Works 
![How it Works](images/4.png)

### Step 1: User Registration  
- Users register to the system with a unique username and a password.

![register](videos/register.gif)

### Step 2: User Login  
- Users log in with their registered credentials, then selecting their role as: **Donor** or **Recipient**.

![login donor](videos/donor%20login.gif)

![recipient login](videos/Recipient%20login.gif)

### Step 3: Donor Workflow  
1. **Add Donation**: Donors provide item details (e.g., name, description, quantity, and pickup location).

![add donation](videos/add%20donation.gif)  

2. **View Donations**: Track all donated items and their statuses (available, reserved, etc.).

![add donation](videos/view%20donation.gif)   

3. **Edit Donations**: Modify item details or update pickup location.

![edit donation](videos/edit%20donation.gif) 

4. **Remove Donations**: Remove donated items as long as they are available.

![remove donation](videos/remove%20donation.gif) 

### Step 4: Recipient Workflow  
1. **View Donations**: Recipients browse available donations.

![view available donation](videos/view%20avail%20items.gif) 

2. **Reserve Items**: Reserve an item and specify a pickup time.

![reserve](videos/reserve.gif) 

3. **Track Reservations**: View reserved items and their pickup details.

![view reserve](videos/view%20reserve.gif) 

4. **Remove Reservations**: Remove reserved items.

![remove reserve](videos/remove%20reserve.gif) 

### Step 5: Database Management  
- All user and donation data are stored in MySQL tables, ensuring persistence and integrity.

![sql user](images/user.png)

![sql donation](images/donation.png)

![sql donationstatus](images/donationstatus.png)

![sql donor](images/donor.png)


### Step 6: Status Updates  
- Reserved items are marked with the recipient's username and pickup schedule.  
- Donors can view the updated status of their donations.

## Database Integration and Operations 
![Database Integration and Operations](images/13.png)

### Database Configuration
The application uses a MySQL database to store user data, donated items, and reservation details. The database connection is established using the JDBC API.

### Connection Setup

The database connection is managed in the `HearDropDB` class. A sample code snippet for establishing the connection is provided below:
``` java
public class HearDropDB {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/";
    private static final String DBNAME = "HearDrop";
    private static String USER = "root";
    private static String PASSWORD = "password";
    private static final String INIT_FILE = "C:\\Users\\denre\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\HearDrop\\src\\init.sql";

    public static Connection getConnection() {
        try {
            return attemptConnection(URL + DBNAME, USER, PASSWORD);
        }
```
Ensure the database server is running, and the credentials match your local setup.

### CRUD Functions
The CRUD functions are encased on the dao package where it contains the `BaseDAO` class that contains the basic CRUD operations, the `DonationDAO` and the `UserDAO`.
1. **Create**
- **Adding Users**: During registration, user details are inserted into the `Users` table.
- **Adding Donations**: Donors add items to the `Donation` table, including a description, pickup location, and availability status.
```java
public boolean addDonation(Donation donation) {
    String donationQuery = "INSERT INTO Donation (item_name, description, quantity, pickup_location) " +
                            "VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
    String donorQuery = "INSERT INTO Donor (donation_id, donor_id, donor_username) " +
                        "VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
    String statusQuery = "INSERT INTO DonationStatus (donation_id, status) VALUES (?, ?)";

    try {
        boolean donationAdded = add(donationQuery, donation.getItemName(), donation.getDescription(), donation.getQuantity(), donation.getPickupLocation());
        if (donationAdded) {
            int donationId = getLastInsertId();
            boolean donorAdded = add(donorQuery, donationId, donation.getDonorId(), donation.getDonorUsername());
            boolean statusAdded = add(statusQuery, donationId, donation.getStatus());
            return donorAdded && statusAdded;
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return false;
}
```
2. **Read**
- **View Donations**: Fetches all available donations from the `Donations` table.
- **View Reserved Items**: Retrieves items reserved by a specific recipient.
```java
    public List<Donation> getAvailableDonations() {
        String query = "SELECT d.id, d.item_name, d.description, d.quantity, d.pickup_location, " +
                       "don.donor_id, don.donor_username, " +
                       "ds.status, ds.recipient_username, ds.pickup_datetime " +
                       "FROM Donation d " +
                       "JOIN Donor don ON d.id = don.donation_id " +
                       "JOIN DonationStatus ds ON d.id = ds.donation_id " +
                       "WHERE ds.status = 'Available'";
        return getList(query, Donation.class);
    }
```
3. **Update**
- **Edit Donated Items**: Updates donation details based on donor input.
```java
public boolean updateDonation(Donation donation) {
    String donationQuery = "UPDATE Donation SET item_name = ?, description = ?, quantity = ?, pickup_location = ? " +
                            "WHERE id = ?";
    String donorQuery = "UPDATE Donor SET donor_id = ?, donor_username = ? WHERE donation_id = ?";
    String statusQuery = "UPDATE DonationStatus SET status = ?, recipient_username = ?, pickup_datetime = ? " +
                            "WHERE donation_id = ?";

    boolean donationUpdated = update(donationQuery, donation.getItemName(), donation.getDescription(), 
                                        donation.getQuantity(), donation.getPickupLocation(), donation.getId());

    boolean donorUpdated = update(donorQuery, donation.getDonorId(), donation.getDonorUsername(), donation.getId());

    boolean statusUpdated = update(statusQuery, donation.getStatus(), donation.getRecipientUsername(), 
                                    Timestamp.valueOf(donation.getPickupDatetime()), donation.getId());

    return donationUpdated && donorUpdated && statusUpdated;
}
```

4. **Delete**
- **Remove Donated Items**: Deletes donated items from the `donation` table.
```java
    public boolean removeDonation(int id) {
        String query = "DELETE FROM Donation WHERE id = ?";
        return remove(query, id);
    }
}
```

## SDG Implementation 
![SDG Implementation](images/8.png)

### This project focuses on two key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

1. **Zero Hunger (SDG 2)**: 
   - **Facilitates Equitable Distribution**: HearDrop helps bridge the gap between donors and recipients, ensuring that food and essential resources are distributed to those who need them most, thus contributing to the eradication of hunger.
   - **Community Support**: By creating a platform for resource sharing, it empowers communities to support each other, enhancing food security and reducing hunger in vulnerable populations.
   - **Local Engagement**: Encourages local involvement and volunteerism, fostering a sense of community and collective effort towards ending hunger.

2. **Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12)**: 
   - **Minimizes Waste**: HearDrop promotes the efficient use of resources by redirecting surplus food and goods from donors to recipients, thus minimizing waste and promoting sustainability.
   - **Encourages Sustainable Practices**: By facilitating the donation and reuse of items, it supports sustainable consumption patterns, reducing the environmental impact of waste.
   - **Resource Optimization**: Helps optimize the use of available resources, ensuring that useful items are not discarded but instead serve to meet the needs of others.

### How HearDrop Achieves These Goals:

- **User-Friendly Platform**: Provides an intuitive and accessible platform for users to donate and receive items easily, ensuring that the process of sharing resources is seamless and efficient.
- **Tracking and Reporting**: Implements tracking of donations and their impact, allowing users to see the tangible benefits of their contributions and encouraging more consistent and meaningful participation.
- **Educational Outreach**: Raises awareness about the importance of zero hunger and responsible consumption through educational materials and community engagement, fostering a culture of sustainability and empathy.
